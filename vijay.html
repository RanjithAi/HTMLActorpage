  Drawing from Turkic Sufi sources, ʿAzāzīl was neither an angel nor a jinn, but an undefined being. He grew up pious and was lifted up to live with the angels in the first heaven. Then he was sent by God to the jinn on earth to persuade them to follow the right path. Since most jinn didn't listen, they were burned by God's fire. However, since ʿAzāzīl's piety increased he was bestowed with angelic qualities and placed in the seventh heaven, until he became proud of his achievements and refused to prostrate himself before Adam.[6]
